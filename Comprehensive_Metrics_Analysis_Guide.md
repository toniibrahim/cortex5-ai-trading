# Comprehensive Metrics Analysis Guide (Improvement 7.2)

## Overview
This guide explains the professional-grade performance metrics implemented in Improvement 7.2 for CortexBacktestWorking.mq5. The system now provides institutional-quality analysis far beyond basic profit/loss tracking.

## What is Comprehensive Metrics Analysis?

Traditional backtesting typically shows:
- Final balance
- Total profit/loss
- Number of trades
- Basic win rate

**Comprehensive metrics analysis** provides 50+ professional metrics including:
- Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe, Sortino ratios)
- Detailed risk analysis (VaR, drawdown analysis)
- Trade quality metrics (expectancy, profit factor)
- Time-based analysis (holding periods, consistency)
- Advanced risk measures (Ulcer Index, Kelly Criterion)

This enables professional strategy evaluation and optimization.

    datetime open_time;
    datetime close_time;
    double entry_price;
    double exit_price;
    double profit_loss;
    
    // IMPROVEMENT 7.2: Enhanced tracking
    double mae;              // Maximum Adverse Excursion
    double mfe;              // Maximum Favorable Excursion
    int holding_time_hours;  // Trade duration
    string exit_reason;      // Why trade was closed
