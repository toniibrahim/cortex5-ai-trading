**✅ FIXED: -407% Returns** → Enhanced profit targeting  
**✅ FIXED: 95+ Trades/Day** → Intelligent frequency control  
**✅ FIXED: No SELL Actions** → Balanced action training  
**✅ FIXED: Poor Risk Management** → Multi-layer protection  

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Neural Network
- **Type**: Double-Dueling Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN)
- **Memory**: LSTM layers for market pattern recognition
- **Features**: 35-dimensional state space with technical indicators
- **Actions**: 6 actions (BUY_STRONG, BUY_WEAK, SELL_STRONG, SELL_WEAK, HOLD, FLAT)
- **Training**: Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) for efficient learning

### Risk Management Layers
1. **Position Limits**: Maximum holding times (48-72 hours)
2. **Profit Targets**: Automatic exits at 1.8-2.5x ATR
3. **Emergency Stops**: Hard dollar limits ($150-500 per trade)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- MetaTrader 5 platform
- Windows environment
- Basic understanding of forex trading
- ⚠️ **Start with demo account for testing**

### Installation
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cortex5.git
   cd cortex5
   ```

2. **Copy files to MetaTrader 5**:
   - Copy `*.mq5` files to `MQL5/Experts/` folder
   - Compile in MetaEditor (F7)

3. **Train the AI model** (Optional - use pre-trained):
   ```
   Run Cortextrainingv5.mq5 script in MetaTrader 5
   Wait for training completion (may take several hours)
   ```

4. **Backtest the system**:
   ```
   Run CortexBacktestWorking.mq5 to test performance
   Review generated performance report
   ```

5. **Deploy for live trading**:
   ```
   Attach cortex5.mq5 to your chart
   Configure risk parameters (start conservative)
   Monitor performance closely
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Risk Management Settings (cortex5.mq5)
```cpp
input double InpRiskPercent = 2.0;      // Risk per trade (% of account)
input double InpMaxDrawdown = 10.0;     // Maximum account drawdown %
input int    InpMaxHoldingHours = 72;   // Maximum position holding time
input double InpEmergencyStopLoss = 500.0; // Hard dollar stop loss
```

### Training Parameters (Cortextrainingv5.mq5)
```cpp
input int    InpYears = 3;               // Years of training data
input double InpSellPromotion = 0.3;    // SELL action promotion weight
input bool   InpEnhancedRewards = true; // Use multi-factor rewards
input bool   InpUsePositionFeatures = true; // Position-aware training
```

```cpp
InpRiskPercent = 0.5;        // Very low risk (0.5% per trade)
InpMaxDrawdown = 5.0;        // Conservative drawdown limit
InpEmergencyStopLoss = 100.0; // Small dollar stop loss
InpMaxHoldingHours = 24;     // Short holding times
```
