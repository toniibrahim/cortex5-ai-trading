# Analysis of the Cortex EURUSD M5 Scalping Model

## ðŸ“Š Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive technical analysis of the Cortex AI trading system, a sophisticated MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisor that employs a Double-Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with LSTM memory for automated forex trading. The system has been extensively enhanced through Phase 1-3 improvements to address critical profitability issues identified in earlier versions.

## ðŸ§  1. Training Script â€“ Cortextrainingv5.mq5

### Methodology & Model Architecture

The training script employs a **Double-Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with an LSTM memory component**, indicating a deep reinforcement learning approach. The model is "double" DQN (to reduce overestimation bias) and "dueling" (separating value and advantage streams), with an LSTM to capture temporal patterns.

**Neural Network Architecture:**
- **Three dense hidden layers** (default 64 neurons each)
- **LSTM layer** (32 units by default) for temporal pattern recognition
- **Dueling heads**: Separate value vs. advantage streams (32 units each)
- **State space**: 35-dimensional feature vector
- **Action space**: 6 actions (BUY_STRONG, BUY_WEAK, SELL_STRONG, SELL_WEAK, HOLD, FLAT)

This architecture is advanced for trading, aiming to let the agent learn stateful patterns in EUR/USD price series (memory of recent bars via LSTM) and balance long/short actions. The original model only learned long bias, which dueling and reward design address.

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

The trainer loads up to **3 years of historical data** on EURUSD at M5 and multiple auxiliary timeframes (M1, M5, H1, H4, D1). It computes a rich feature vector of **35 features per bar** to describe market state.

**Feature Categories:**
- Classic technical indicators across multiple timeframes
- Bar volatility and volume metrics
- Multi-period moving averages and momentum (EMA slope)
- ATR-based volatility measurements
- Multi-timeframe trend signals
- Oscillators (RSI)
- Volatility regime flags
- Temporal features (time of day, day of week, session, month half)
- **Position context** (indices 12â€“14): Current position direction, size, and unrealized P&L

**Normalization:** All features are scaled to [0,1] via minâ€“max normalization using the full dataset's min/max per feature.

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive feature engineering combining price action with market context
- Broad view of market conditions including volatility regime and time-based patterns

**Cons:**
- Large and hand-crafted feature set with embedded assumptions
- Potential redundancy or noise in some features
- Risk of information leakage through dataset-wide normalization

### Training Process & Hyperparameters

Training iterates through historical bars in **chronological order** (oldest to newest) for multiple epochs (default 3). Key parameters:

- **Epsilon-greedy policy**: Anneals from 100% random to 5% random over time
- **Experience replay buffer**: 200,000 capacity with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)
- **Learning rate**: 5e-5 (conservative for stability)
- **Batch size**: 64
- **Gamma (discount factor)**: 0.995
- **Target network sync**: Every 3,000 steps

**Actions Available:**
1. **Buy-Strong/Weak**: Full vs. half-sized long positions
2. **Sell-Strong/Weak**: Full vs. half-sized short positions  
3. **Hold**: Maintain current position
4. **Flat**: Explicitly close position

**Pros:**
- Faithful step-by-step trading simulation
- Well-regarded RL techniques for stability
- Conservative hyperparameters to avoid instability

**Cons:**
- Treats entire multi-year span as one continuous episode
- Complex indexing that must maintain causal order
- No natural terminal state for forex trading

### Reward Design and Phase 1â€“3 Enhancements

A standout aspect is the **heavily engineered reward function** that directly addresses failure modes identified in earlier versions.

#### Phase 1 Enhancements (Critical Profitability Fixes)
- **Holding time penalties**: Small negative reward per hour position is open
- **Profit target bonus**: Reward when agent exits at predetermined ATR-based threshold
- **Quick exit bonus**: Extra reward for profitable trades closed in <24 hours
- **Maximum holding limits**: Prevents catastrophic 700+ hour positions

#### Phase 2 Improvements (Enhanced Learning)
- **Drawdown penalty**: Penalizes letting trades run deep into negative territory
- **SELL action promotion**: Bonus rewards for taking short positions (fixes long bias)
- **FLAT action weighting**: Boosts rewards for position exits
- **Multi-factor reward calculation**: Sophisticated learning signals

#### Phase 3 Advanced Features (Sophisticated Behavior)
- **Market regime awareness**: Bonuses for actions that fit market conditions
- **Position-aware features**: AI knows current holding time and P&L status
- **Dynamic market adaptation**: Responds to trending vs. ranging markets

**Pros:**
- Directly tackles identified failure modes (-407% returns, 700+ hour holds)
- Incorporates domain knowledge for human-like profitable behavior
- Comprehensive reward shaping addresses specific weaknesses

**Cons:**
- Extensive reward shaping could introduce biases
- Complexity makes credit assignment less clear
- Heavy reliance on specific parameter values may not generalize

### Parameter Tuning & Potential Weaknesses

The training allows many input parameters but doesn't perform automated hyperparameter tuning. Key considerations:

- **Learning rate**: Extremely low (5e-5) for stability but may require many epochs
- **Training duration**: Only 3 epochs over 3 years of data (relatively light)
- **Overfitting mitigation**: 15% dropout and 20% validation set
- **Data split issue**: Implementation may validate on oldest rather than newest data

**Recommendations:**
- Verify validation covers most recent data for true forward testing
- Regular re-evaluation of reward parameters for current market conditions
- Consider expanding training epochs if underfitting occurs

## ðŸ¤– 2. Trading Program â€“ cortex5.mq5

### Real-Time Signal Logic

The Cortex5 Expert Advisor uses the trained model's "brain" in live trading. On each new M5 bar:

1. **Feature Construction**: Builds same 35-feature state vector
2. **Normalization**: Uses min/max ranges saved from training
3. **Prediction**: Runs neural network to get Q-values for all 6 actions
4. **Decision**: Selects action with highest Q-value (greedy policy)

**Key Features:**
- Mirrors training environment exactly
- Includes current position context in state
- No additional signal filtering (model drives decisions directly)
- Comprehensive logging of decisions and reasoning

### Trade Execution & Position Management

The EA translates model actions into trading operations with comprehensive risk management:

#### Action Translation

#### Position Sizing
- **Smart Risk Sizing**: Enabled by default (InpUseRiskSizing=true)
- **Risk-based calculation**: Uses account balance and ATR-based stop distance
- **Volatility adjustment**: Scales down position size in high volatility periods
- **Signal strength mapping**: Strong signals = full size, weak signals = half size

#### Position Scaling & Management
- **Opposite position closure**: Automatically closes opposite positions on new signals
- **Position scaling**: Adjusts existing position size based on new signal strength
- **Single aggregated position**: Prevents multiple parallel trades in same direction

### Risk Management & Enhancements in Live Trading

The EA contains **multiple layers of risk control** that mirror Phase 1-3 training enhancements:

#### Time-Based Controls
- **Maximum Holding Time**: 72 hours default (prevents 700+ hour disasters)

- **Spread Filters**: Avoid trading in high spread conditions
- **Win Rate Monitoring**: Pause if recent performance deteriorates

#### Trading Frequency Controls
- **Daily Trade Limits**: Maximum 8 trades per day (prevents overtrading)
- **Minimum Bar Spacing**: At least 4 bars between trades
- **Circuit Breakers**: Multiple conditions can pause trading
- **Cost Management**: Accounts for commission and realistic costs

### Consistency between Training and Trading

The EA implements what the model was trained on with high fidelity:

**Strengths:**
- Identical feature definitions and calculations
- Same position management logic as training
- Proper symbol/timeframe enforcement
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

**Minor Inconsistency Identified:**
- Training may override features 32-34 with position/regime data
